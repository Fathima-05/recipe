            Founded in 2025, Savoré was born from a simple obsession: the pursuit of the perfect bite.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that great food is an art form that shouldn't be rushed. 
            "Savoré" isn't just our name—it is our philosophy. It means taking 
            the time to appreciate the complexity of a slow-simmered sauce, the 
            crunch of garden-fresh greens, and the warmth of a shared meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our kitchen is a lab of flavor where tradition meets innovation. 
            We source our ingredients from local artisans who share our commitment 
            to quality, ensuring that every plate we serve is a tribute to the 
            land and the craft.
